    "The Fellowship of the Ring - the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien's three-volume epic, The Lord of the Rings - is set in the imaginary world of Middle-earth, a place of high and heroic adventure populated by many strange creatures - most notably hobbits, a peace-loving 'little-people' with furry feet. Hobbits are cheerful and shy, enjoy large meals and long naps, and almost never lock their doors at night. But dark forces from the enemy land of Mordor threaten these lovable beings, along with the other inhabitants of Middle-earth - dwarves, elves, and even men."
